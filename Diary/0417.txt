Today, I practiced speaking in English. That's the reason why I wrote this dairy in English.
I like Hyeokju and love him, but I usually punch to him.
It's very bad habit so I want to change my behavior.
I don't know why I do that but it is not good action for us so I must not fix.
I appreciate to HJ, he taught me a native English.
I am not good at English, but I can practice more.
I am very very happy to meet him.
